        Hello! My name is Valentina. I live in Ukraine. I recently graduated
        from Front-end studies with the study of React. Delighted with React. I
        wrote several applications on it. I continue to work on my projects and
        look for new on Freelance. Looking for a job trainee or junior Front-end
        Developer (React). I am improving my English. Now I have an Intermediate
        level. I consider myself purposeful. I learn easily. I'm a crazy
        perfectionist.. Able to effectively self-manage during independent
        projects, as well as collaborate in a team setting. I will be useful in
        any company.
